## 📖 About The Project
B.Tech ExamPrep Genius was born from the idea of creating a centralized, intelligent study tool for engineering students. Traditional exam preparation often involves disorganized notes and a lack of immediate help for complex problems.  

This platform addresses that by providing a structured, easy-to-navigate interface with high-value, curated content and an AI-powered assistant to make learning more efficient and effective.  

**Goal:** Help students study smarter, not just harder, by focusing on what truly matters for exam success.
