📖 About The Project
B.Tech ExamPrep Genius was born from the idea of creating a centralized, intelligent study tool for engineering students. Traditional exam preparation often involves disorganized notes and a lack of immediate help for complex problems. This platform addresses that by providing a structured, easy-to-navigate interface with high-value, curated content and an AI-powered assistant to make learning more efficient and effective.

The goal is to help students study smarter, not just harder, by focusing on what truly matters for exam success.

✨ Key Features
🧠 AI Study Assistant: Integrated with the OpenAI API, it provides instant, context-aware explanations for any question, acting as a 24/7 personal tutor.
📚 Curated Question Bank: Access to a rich database of frequently repeated, high-priority exam questions across 4 major engineering branches (AI/ML, CSE, ECE, EEE).
🔍 Smart Search & Filtering: Powerful search functionality to find questions by topic, keywords, branch, semester, difficulty, or unit.
🔖 Personal Bookmarks with Notes: Save important questions for quick revision and add personal notes to remember key points.
🎥 Integrated Video Tutorials: Curated YouTube videos are linked directly to relevant questions for enhanced visual learning.
🔐 Secure User Authentication: Seamless and secure Google OAuth login to provide a personalized and persistent user experience.
📱 Responsive Design: Fully responsive interface that works beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
